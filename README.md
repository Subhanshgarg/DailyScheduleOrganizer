# JWT Generation, Validation, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This section explains the security mechanism implemented in the project using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication and **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** for authorization. These mechanisms ensure secure access to the API by verifying users' identity and granting access based on their assigned roles.

## JWT Generation

### 1. User Login
The user initiates the authentication process by sending a **login request** containing the `username` and `password` to the server.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/auth/login`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    ```
    
Upon receiving the login request, the server **validates** the credentials by comparing them against the stored user data in the database.

### 2. JWT Token Generation
Once the credentials are validated and the user is authenticated, the server generates a **JWT** that contains the following claims:
- **User ID**: A unique identifier for the user.
- **Username**: The user's username.
- **Roles**: The user's roles, such as `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_MANAGER`,`ROLE_ADMIN`, etc.
- **Issued At (iat)**: The time the token was issued.
- **Expiration (exp)**: The expiration time of the token.

The server uses a **secret key** (e.g., `JWT_SECRET_KEY`) to sign the token, ensuring that the token is tamper-proof and can be verified on subsequent requests.

Example JWT structure:

- **Header**: Contains information about the algorithm used for signing the token (e.g., `HS256`).
- **Payload**: Contains the claims such as user ID, roles, and expiration time.
- **Signature**: Generated by signing the header and payload with the secret key.

The JWT is sent back to the client in the response.

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwicm9sZSI6Ik1hbmFnZXIiLCJpYXQiOjE2Mzg5NzQwMDB9.X2n3Vgkqkjl2z5OkLhDxvtuYXs1NlqAn4u0lbnNTnm4"
